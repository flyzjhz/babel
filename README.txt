Babel
=====
Babel is a internet connector especially for Linux OS, which
could substitute RUIJIE[1] client. Babel is based on Mentohust[2]
for the reasons as follows.
0, Recently, I could not surf the internet with Mentohust under
Linux OS so I determine to maintain one for my laborary[3] and
me.
1, It seems that mentohust has nobody to maintain now.
2, Mentohust has no good performance and lots of bugs have to
be fixed.
